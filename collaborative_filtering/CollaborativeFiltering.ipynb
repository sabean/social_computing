    "# Exercise 3: Collaborative Filtering Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is the task of automatically predicting a user's interests based on a larger user group's behavior. If a target user shares similar preferences on items or products with another user, they are likely to favor other items of that user as well. The idea of collaborative filtering recommenders is to find users the target user is similar to and recommend the items highly rated by those users. The problem of this exercise will be to implement a collaborative filtering recommender system based on the approach of [1].\n",

    "## Problem 3.1: Movie Recommender System\n",
    "You will work with subset of the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org) dataset which contains 1862 movies and 100k ratings. The input is provided in two data files, a listing of movies (_u.item_) and their ratings by users (_u.data_).<br>\n",
    "For the _u.item_ file, each row represents a movie with its attributes separated by '|' but the only attributes that matter for the exercise are the movie ID and the movie name. For the _u.data_ file, each row represents one user's rating for a movie. The attributes are:\n",
    "* user ID\n",
    "* movie ID\n",
    "* rating\n",
    "* timestamp (not relevant for the exercise)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task will be to implement a collaborative filtering recommender for the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering Recommender\n",
    "The main goal is to find a list of users similar to the target user for recommendations. There are several ways of measuring similarity, e.g. using the cosine similarity or the Euclidean distance. For simplicity reasons, the latter will be used. The estimated rating for the target user for each movie is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{u,i} = \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in N_i(u)} w_{u,v}r_{v,i}}{\\sum_{v \\in N_i(u)} w_{u,v}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_{u,i}$ is the estimated recommendation of item $i$ for target user $u$. $N_i(u)$ is the set of similar users to target user $u$ for the designated item $i$. $w_{u,v}$ is the similarity score between users $u$ and $v$ (used as a weighting factor).<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Overview\n",
    "**Write a Python program that implements a simple collaborative filtering movie recommender.** The entry point to your recommendation engine should be a function that takes a user ID, and paths to the two aforementioned datasets. The function should return the top twenty recommended movies for that user (which were not rated by the user yet). The output should be a list of tuples, containing a movie and its estimated rating - sorted by the highest rating. You can either use the templates given below or design your recommendation engine the way you want, but straightforward collborative filtering is highly recommended. Make sure that the code is clean, readable, and well documented. **Test your program for user 15.**"

    "### Task 1: Creating The Dictionaries\n",
    "The first thing to do is **implementing two functions that create the dictionaries** for the movies and the user ratings. For the movies, use the movie ID as a key and the movie name as the value. Concerning the user ratings dictionary, a dict of dicts format like ```{u1_id: {m1_id: rating1, m2_id: rating 2, ...}, u2_id: {...}, ...}``` might be useful since the user's rating needs to be stored for each movie."
